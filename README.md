# Malicious_Account_Detection-using-ANN
A method for identifying fraudulent or malicious user accounts on internet sites involves constructing a model using artificial neural networks (ANNs). To identify abnormalities and categorise accounts as malicious or legitimate, the model examines numerous user activity patterns and behavioural data. This study shows how machine learning algorithms can improve the security of online platforms and has real-world applications in a number of areas, including social media platforms, online banking, and e-commerce websites.
